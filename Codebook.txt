The data types, unit and descriptions of the final data set - "data" are presented below:

df1
	data frame, identifies the training data set
df2
	data frame, identifies the test data set
subject
	numeric, identifies the subject code of the person who carried out the experiment. The experiments have been carried 	out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years
body_acc_x
	numeric, identifies the estimated x-axis body acceleration 
body_acc_y
	numeric, identifies the estimated y-axis body acceleration 
body_acc_z
	numeric, identifies the estimated z-axis body acceleration 
body_gyro_x
	numeric, identifies the estimated x-axis acceleration from the accelerometer
body_gyro_y
	numeric, identifies the estimated y-axis acceleration from the accelerometer
body_gyro_z
	numeric, identifies the estimated z-axis acceleration from the accelerometer
total_acc_x
	numeric, identifies the total x-axis acceleration 
total_acc_y
	numeric, identifies the total y-axis acceleration 
total_acc_z
	numeric, identifies the total z-axis acceleration 
activity
	numeric, identifies the activity code. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 		SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
activity_name
	character, links the class labels with their activity name
mean
	vector, contains the mean values of each of the columns mentioned above (excluding the activity_name)
stdev
	vector, contains the stdev values of each of the columns mentioned above (excluding the activity_name)
data_num
	data frame, contains the final data set, processed, with only numeric values
data_sec
	data frame, contains the second data set, with the average of each variable per activity/per subject
=================================================================================================================
Temp variables:

body_acc_#_train, body_gyro_#_train, total_acc_#_train,
body_acc_#_test, body_gyro_#_test, total_acc_#_test  # in {x,y,z}
	list, used to read the lines from the txt files
data
	data frame, contains the merged data, unprocessed
d
	vector, used to store the mean of each variable per activity/per subject
test
	data frame, subset of the data_num for each subject
test_a
	data frame, subset of the test for each activity
